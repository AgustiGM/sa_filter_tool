Now I can't even join any rooms, because (I'm thinking) of some glitch in the \"confirming you're not a robot\" screen. It just closes and sends me back to the main page. After all these years, you'd think TC fixed issues such as these... Disappointing."

Will use for few days before going to PRO. Would have been nice to have an option to remove the default activities. All my activities are custom. Dont want to track shop, cinema rat and all other default activities \ud83d\ude0a. Also to have activities in the list rather than icons so the full name of custom activity can be displayed. Desktop app?"
